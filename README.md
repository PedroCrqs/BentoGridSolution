## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid Layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project in the programming world and, perhaps, my first project as a future developer. I started this project with the goal of consolidating all the theoretical knowledge I had learned about HTML and CSS, and this was the first opportunity I had to practice these languages. I confess that it took me a few hours to solve some issues involving CSS Grid. The main secret was mastering the grid-template-columns, grid-template-area and grid-template-rows properties. I didn't have any help from anyone and this was a great way to test my own ability to learn on my own. Ultimately, this was a great learning opportunity and I am grateful to the challenger for providing me with this.
